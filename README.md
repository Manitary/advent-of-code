# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event that started in 2015 that consists of an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of programming puzzles of varying levels of difficulty, which can be solved with your language of choice.

I learned about AoC in 2017, and used it to explore [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/); this repository contains all my solutions.  
I do not plan to revise solutions using the same language, although it may still happen if I ever feel like it.  
Some problems may have more than one solution if I am trying a few different approaches e.g. to compare execution time.
